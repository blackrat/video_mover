#### An automated media download scheduler and catalogue maintainer ####

Media Rover is a command line tool responsible for managing a directory of television shows.  It monitors various usenet indexing sites for new and/or missing episodes and schedules them for download with a binary newsgroup reader.  Once downloaded, Media Rover renames and catalogues the file on disk according to series name, season and episode number.
