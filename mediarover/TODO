mediarover TODO
===============
- update/rewrite all unittests to reflect recent changes
   - write test for mediarover.util.filesystem to verify that it is correctly
	caching episodes when they are retrieved
- allow user to specify whether or not they want pre-season recap episodes 
(ie. 3x00)
- look at handling mini or fractional episodes 
(ie. Big Brother (IT) - 9x45a - Daily Show).
	- update regex to look for optional letter following episode number
	- store it in episode object and spit it out whenever converting episode
	to string
- update custom errors to allow setting an error number.  That way I can 
handle different numbered error specifically
	- update util.filesystem to number different errors
- standardize category types that are supported by application
	- each source should return one of supported categories when queried
- update mediarover.error so that it doesn't accept arguments to apply to the error message
  - update to accept a logging level
- to address the possibility of nzb's having the same title, look at using the url or other piece of data to make title unique
- think about duplicate episodes on disk (no timestamp) and how MR handles them when reading in a series episodes
- when using shutil library to move a file, it uses copystat() to copy permissions, access time, etc.  This causes problems if the user doesn't 
  have permission to set this type of metadata on a file.  
  - look at replacing shutil.move() with a straight copy()
  - write my own move utility that checks for such errors
- to determine quality of existing episodes on disk
  - grab all files in a series
  - group files by size (group if within 10% of average size)
  - show users list of average sizes and number of episodes in that range
  - allow them to set quality for those episodes
- move code that creates series objects to its own method in mediarover.series
